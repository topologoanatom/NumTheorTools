# NumTheorTools
Library targeted on solving common number theory problems within 128-bit integer range.
Implemented features : 

1. Factoring 128-bit integers using combination of single polynomial version of Quadratic Sieve and Pollard's Rho algorithms;
2. Primality testing : classical Miller Rabin and Quadratic Frobenius test using Fibonacci's polynomial;
3. Primitive roots of Zn;
4. Euler and Carmichael functions;
5. Other auxiliary stuff like Shanks-Tonelli algorithm or Chinese Remainder Theorem.
